import sys

# The script will print reverse complement of a sequence provided when run.  The objective is to use our knowledge of loops to "loop through" the nucleotide letters in a sequence and build a new sequence where each entry is the complement of the corresponding entry in the original sequence.  So, if the third nucleotide in our test sequence is an "A", then the new sequence should have a "T" in its place.  Finally, the sequence needs to be reversed in its orderdering.  Some suggested steps are provided below.

# define temporary sequence variable for input value from command line/terminal (remember to use the sys.argv[] command).



# define an empty string where you will save the output of each step of your loop.



# write a for loop to iterate through all of the nucleotides in seq






# finally, use the print function to print your output back into the console when done.
